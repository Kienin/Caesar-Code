# 🗝️ Caesar Cipher
This Python script implements the Caesar Cipher, a simple and classic encryption technique. It allows you to either encrypt or decrypt messages using a specified key.

## 📜 Overview
The Caesar Cipher works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number (the key). For example, with a key of 1, 'A' becomes 'B', 'B' becomes 'C', and so on.

## 🔧 Features
 - Encrypt or Decrypt: Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt a message.
 - User Input: Accepts user input for the message and key.
 - Handles Case Sensitivity: Maintains the case of the original letters.

## 🛠️ Usage
- Run the Script: Execute the script in a Python environment.
- Choose Mode: Enter "encrypt" or "e" to encrypt a message, or "decrypt" or "d" to decrypt a message.
- Input Message: Provide the message you wish to encrypt or decrypt.
- Enter Key: Specify the key number (1-26).
- View Result: The script will display the translated text.

## 📚 Example
Input: "HELLO", Key: 3 --->
Output: "KHOOR"

## 🎉 Conclusion
The Caesar Cipher is a fun and simple way to learn about encryption. Experiment with different messages and keys to see how it works!
